== Introduction
There is frequently a need for teams to collectively decide on a location to head to for lunch.
While each team member has an idea in mind, not everyone gets heard in the commotion and much
time is spent to arrive at what may as well be a random choice.

== API
=== GET /restaurantpicker/pick?restaurants={restaurants}

This API will be called by the frontend, where the user will individually provide their restaurant preferences.
Frontend will provide a list of restaurants to the Backend separated by comma
